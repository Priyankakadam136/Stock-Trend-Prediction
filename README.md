# Stock-Trend-Prediction
Stock trend prediction refers to predicting future price trend of stocks for seeking profit maximum of stock investment. Although it has arised broad attention in stock markets, it is still a tough task not only because the stock markets are complex and easily volatile but also because real short-term stock data is so limited that existing stock prediction models could be far from perfect, especially for deep neural networks. As a kind of time-series data, the underlying patterns of stock data are easily influenced by any tiny noises. Thus, how to augment limited stock price data is an open problem in stock trend prediction, since most data augmentation schemes adopted in image processing cannot be brutally used here. To this end, we devise a simple yet effective LSTM method for stock trend prediction. The proposed method is to stock price data.
Finally , here it concludes the stock price data fed to the prediction models.
